# Campus Companions


## Overview
Campus Companions is a client-side JavaScript web application that helps users explore the BCIT campus and helps track assignments via your set. The app displays an interactable map of campus where you can click to view specific buildings and their floor plans, as well as a tab where you add, edit, or delete assignments, and a schedule tab that functions similarly. Users can edit their profile to change their username and display name, as well as assign a set for their account to make use of the assignment feature.

Developed for the COMP 1800 course, this project applies User-Centred Design practices and agile project management, and demonstrates integration with Firebase backend services for storing set assignments for users.
